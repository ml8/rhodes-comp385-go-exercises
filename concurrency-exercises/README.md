# Part 3: Concurrency Exercises

Each subdirectory of this one contains a small exercise in concurrency, and
contains its own instructions.

These are designed to progress through topics, and the 5th exercise combines
concepts from previous exercises.

Each subdirectory contains instructions for running/testing from the command
line.

If you are using GoLand, __right click on the folder__ to run/test the exercise.
